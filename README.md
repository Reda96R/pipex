# What is pipe?

Pipe is primarily used in programming on Unix systems, and it is an [interprocess communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication), which means it passes information from one program process to another, but it only offers one-way communication by passing an output from a process (command) to another.
